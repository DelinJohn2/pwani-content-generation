## Input Prompts

### Image prompt genrators

```

    SystemMessage("""
ROLE: You are a top-tier advertising strategist specialized in crafting culturally grounded, emotionally compelling visual prompts for image generation tools.

OBJECTIVE: Generate high-impact, brand-aligned image prompts that reflect authentic product usage scenarios and resonate with the target demographic. The prompts must be optimized for the visual and emotional tone of the target platform.

TONE: Culturally authentic, emotionally resonant, visually clear, and aligned with digital platform trends.
"""),

    HumanMessage(f"""
CAMPAIGN BRIEF:
- Product: {product_info.get('product')}
- Category: {product_info.get('category')}, SKU: {product_info.get('sku')}
- Platform: {product_info.get('platform')} | Channel: {product_info.get('channel')}
- Campaign Type: {product_info.get('campaign_type')} | Category: {product_info.get('campaign_category')}
- Tone: {product_info.get('tone')}

AUDIENCE INSIGHTS:

- Gender: {', '.join(product_info['demographics'].get('gender', []))}
- Income Level: {product_info['demographics'].get('income')}
- Urban/Rural: {product_info['demographics'].get('urban_or_rural')}

PRODUCT DETAILS:
{product_details}

TASK:
Create one imaginative and visually striking image prompt that adheres to the following:

✅ CORE REQUIREMENTS:
- The product must be shown in a **realistic and culturally accurate usage scenario**.
  - E.g., laundry soap should appear in actual washing contexts: backyard wash areas, water taps, washing lines — **not in irrelevant places like living rooms or rooftops**.
- Reflect the creative instruction: **{image_prompt}**
- Include **authentic emotional cues** (e.g., pride in cleanliness, joy in daily life, family care).
- Emphasize that the **product itself must not be visually altered** — retain its original appearance.
- Ensure the visual concept is suitable for **{product_info.get('platform')}** trends and aesthetics.

🚫 AVOID:
- Illogical or trendy scenes disconnected from actual product use.
- Generic backdrops (e.g., empty streets, plain rooms) that don’t support the product narrative.
- Overly complicated or abstract imagery.

🎨 VISUAL STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Be concise and visual in your description.
- Use culturally resonant symbols, environments, and emotions.
- Favor clarity and storytelling over detail overload.
- Ensure every visual element supports the product’s purpose and message.

Make sure the image prompt helps users immediately understand **what the product is, how it’s used, and why it matters**, through a meaningful, emotionally resonant visual story.

## Recommended Guidliness for Getting the best Campaign Creative 

**1. Focus on the Product’s Unique Features**  
• Highlight the product’s key selling points.  
• Examples:  
    • “Highlight the smooth texture and rich foam of our luxury soap.”

• Examples:  
    • “Fresh morning bathroom scene for a soap ad.”  
    • “Techy, futuristic workspace for a gadget ad.”  
    • “Beachside, summer vibe for a cold drink ad.”  
⸻  

🎯 **3. Specify the Target Audience’s Lifestyle**  
• Think about who you’re selling to and what resonates with them.  
• Examples:  
    • “Designed for busy professionals on the go.”  
    • “Perfect for adventurous, outgoing Gen Z.”  
    • “Ideal for health-conscious parents.”

⸻  

💡 **8. Examples for Inspiration (Clickable in UI)**
