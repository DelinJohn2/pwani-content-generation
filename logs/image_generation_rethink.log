Feature family-oriented scenes with mothers doing laundry, emphasizing care and quality. Show before/after stain removal demonstrations. Include bulk packaging visuals to appeal to family purchasing preferences. Use warm, trustworthy color schemes that reflect premium quality. Incorporate agricultural/rural elements subtly to connect with the mixed urban-rural demographic. Show diverse family structures including extended family influences. Feature clean, bright laundry results to demonstrate product efficacy.**\n- Include **authentic emotional cues** (e.g., pride in cleanliness, joy in daily life, family care).\n- Emphasize that the **product itself must not be visually altered** — retain its original appearance.\n- Ensure the visual concept is suitable for **social media** trends and aesthetics.\n\n🚫 AVOID:\n- Illogical or trendy scenes disconnected from actual product use.\n- Generic backdrops (e.g., empty streets, plain rooms) that don’t support the product narrative.\n- Overly complicated or abstract imagery.\n\n🎨 VISUAL STYLE GUIDELINES:\n- Be concise and visual in your description.\n- Use culturally resonant symbols, environments, and emotions.\n- Favor clarity and storytelling over detail overload.\n- Ensure every visual element supports the product’s purpose and message.\n\nMake sure the image prompt helps users immediately understand **what the product is, how it’s used, and why it matters**, through a meaningful, emotionally resonant visual story.\n", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]
